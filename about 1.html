The SAN FELIPE NERI PAROCHIAL SCHOOL started by Miss. Rosa A. Salazar who was then acting as President of the parish Confraternity of our Lady of Lourdes in 1965.

A teacher by profession, Miss ROSA SALAZAR began using the backyard of the San Felipe Neri Parish for classroom activities. The school operated as a nursery center for the next two years. In June 1965, the school opened as a full-time educational institution with a permit to operate from the former Department of Education Miss Rosa Salazar served as the first Principal.

In 1980, the parish was in the process of expanding its area. The school, being a part of a parish, had to be reclaimed for church development. Miss Rosa Salazar, seeing no other alternative, sold the property to the Archdiocese of Manila.

SR. LORETO GALANG, O.P. became the first Religious directress-principal of SFNPS in June, 1981. During her term, a re-examination was done on all phases of operation, from a non-sectarian school to a religious center of learning.

The first few years of the Dominican Sisters were a period of crisis. Full-time administration was a problem since the Dominican Sisters had to commute from the Dominican College Dormitory in San Juan and Vice-Versa every class day. Full time attendance 

Classrooms, as well as enrollees, continued to increase with only a single section for every grade level. The end of school year 1971-72 marked the graduation of the first batch of elementary pupils at SFN. By Match of 1975, the school was able to produce its first group of high school graduates.

The first few years of the Dominican Sisters were a period of crisis. Full-time administration was a problem since the Dominican Sisters had to commute from the Dominican College Dormitory in San Juan and Vice-Versa every class day. Full time attendance to the school was unlikely to happen.

By end of school year 1984-85, the Dominican Sisters decided to take a respite as managers and turned over the responsibility to the Archdiocese of Manila which in turn placed the leadership to the parish priest.

MSGR. SALVADOR R. JOSE, because of dual responsibility, gave up his role as Educator in favor of his pastoral duties. By then, the Archdiocese of Manila offered back the administrative role to the former caretaker, the Dominican Sisters.

SR. MARIA REFUGIO NACION O.P., became the second Directress-principal from the Dominican Order in 1966. During her term, she was able to continue programs implemented by her predecessors.
